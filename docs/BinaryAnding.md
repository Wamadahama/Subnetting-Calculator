<strong>Story: </strong>Binary anding calculator

State of the story: Done

Description of story:
<p>
	When a network is subnetted there are different network ids that are assigned to these subnets. This calculator will allow you to AND a host address and a subnet mask to determine what that addresses network address is.

	Example input :

		Network address  = 192.168.5.35
		Subnet mask = 255.255.255.224
		192.168.5.34 && 255.255.255.224 = 192.168.5.32
</p>

This is the only code that I currently have stuff for, it can be found on the windows store under the name of binary anding. I need to take this code and move it to the current application that I am working on.
